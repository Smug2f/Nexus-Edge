#### About
Nexus Edge  (Nexus) is a private Minecraft forge with cpvp and utility modules in mind  for anarchy-related servers such as 5b5t.<br>
This project was started by Smug after gamesense++ got discontinued by TechAle.But yeah Smug is a total begginer so he would need a lot of training to make this client good 
# Nexus helper
* Smug (client dev)
* OLEPOSSU (Intellij helper , blackout dev )
* DJ PLAYZ (discord moderator)
* VoidMatterRules (for suggering making a voider client)

# From Smug
At the beggining this client will look like trash just adding modules name in the src but after a few moment it might be worth using it along with earthack for the best cpvp experience , no need for japanese client after all =) <br>
* After Thinking why i should continue a client that i will never use?Like the creator said you should start a new client from 0 
* So after a long time of coding i will continue another client , this client need to be meta in order to be the best and kill these bad paste
* I will try my best after a few time to make a meta client like Passc0de did with noxilon , but it will take a long time ... 
*So i think you can give another member the task to do the voider client , hope you will understand

# SideNote From TechAle
* Hi, it's the main dev of gs++.<br>
* Developing gs++ had been really funny and, for who is wondering, the release date was decided for the 27^ December, i have no idea why Sable decided to release it 4 days before lol<br>
* Why am i releasing it? Well, basically every gs++ users are quitting, so, i see no reasons why keeping this private.<br>
* It also got boring developing in minecraft, and the last things i coded were bad+speed coded.<br>
* For the last 2 months the client become a little bit instable, mostly because of bad things i added.<br>
#### I dont suggest to continue gs++, it's really not worth lol, start a client from 0 that is 100%  better.<br>
After this, i'll quit minecraft developement, i wont fork/star anything that is related to minecraft.<br>
If you want to follow me, just know that i'll start creating things that are not for minecraft, mostly university.<br>
